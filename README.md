# cyfrin-audits

This repository is my completion of the [Security and auditing course by Cyfrin](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23).

Each folder is a project that has been audited.

The `external-references` is a collection of useful external repositiories which have reference implementations for
- DeFi protocols
- Smart Contract exploits
- Security checklists
- Weird ERC20 tokens
